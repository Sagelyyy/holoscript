# HoloScript

*A Twitter clone*

### What is HoloScript?

HoloScript is a social app I made for The Odin Project curriculum. It is heavily based off of Twitter. It is written in React, and the backend uses firebase. Its purpose is for learning and displaying the skills I have learned throughout the course. It is the final project in the Javascript course.

### What did I learn anyway?

I have learned so much building this final project. Like how to properly sync up the front and the backend of the app. When a user clicks a heart, it will like the correct post (and not all of them! ðŸ˜‚) and increment a counter to display how many likes the post has. Or using Reacts context to make a global user context that I could use throughout the whole project.  This was my first project that really dug into learning to work with firebase, and while it was challenging, it was also very rewarding once I figured it out. It was also my first real time delving into making a project mobile friendly. Its great to pull up the app on the phone and see it working!

### Thats great, where can I see it?
