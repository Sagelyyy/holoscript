# HoloScript

*A Twitter clone*

### What is HoloScript?

HoloScript is a social app I made for The Odin Project curriculum. It is heavily based off of Twitter. It is written in React, and the backend uses firebase. Its purpose is for learning and displaying the skills I have learned throughout the course. It is the final project in the Javascript course.

### What did I learn anyway?

I have learned so much building this final project. Like how to properly sync up the front and the backend of the site. When a user clicks a heart, it will like the correct post (and not all of them! ðŸ˜‚) and increment a counter to display how many likes the post has. I learned to use Reacts context to make a global user context that I could use throughout the whole project (and not deal with prop drilling). Getting images linked from other websites to display in the post was also an interesting challenge as well, but awesome when I got it working! It was also my first real time delving into making a project mobile friendly. Its great to pull up the site on the phone and see it working!

This was my first project that really dug into learning to work with firebase, and while it was challenging, it was also very rewarding once I figured it out. 

### Thats great, where can I see it?
